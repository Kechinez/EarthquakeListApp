# EarthquakeListApp code challenge

### Tech stack:
Swift, UIKit, MVVM + Coordinator, UI in Storyboard/Xib + in code, Swift Package Manager, Swinject as DI

### Key details:
* Scalable architecture to (possible) support of Server-Driven UI in the future (Concrete models, view models are isolated via protocol-abstractions)
* Using Swift Packages to modularize the project, so some packages can be reused
* Using DI Container to control and handle app dependencies
* Supporting landscape and portrait modes
* Localization
* Unit Tests
